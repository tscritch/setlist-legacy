  <h1>Setlist</h1>

  <p>As a worship leader, I have created short lists of around 20 songs to choose from for the next quarter. It allows the worship team to know the songs more intimately as well as the congregation. However, most of my time spent planning services is spent looking over this list multiple times to find the song that will fit perfectly for that week's service. I have made <i>Setlist</i> to take songs from a list and, using a setlist template, it will create a setlist for the service based on the song's metadata.</p>

  <p>This Node.js app was created using Express, AngularJS and is served up using Docker on a Linode server.</p>
